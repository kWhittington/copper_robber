# Copper Robber
by Kyle Whittington

"Copper Robber", is a puzzle game built with the Unity3D (2D) engine.

## Installation/Play
To run the game locally, use whatever preferred server software to host this directory. To run the game locally, open the project in Unity3D. Open the "StartScreen" scene (Assets/Scenes/CopperRobber/StartScreen.unity). Press the Unity3D "Play" button.

To play the game in your browser, visit [http://kwhittington.github.io/copper_robber/](http://kwhittington.github.io/copper_robber/).

## Controls
The player must push furniture out of the way to reach the piece of copper on each level. The player can move around via the arrow/directional keys. When the player collides against a moveable piece of furniture within the game, they will brace for push. If the player pushes against the object a second time after they have braced for push, they will move that object (or another object touching that object) in the direction of the push.

Once the player reaches the piece of copper on a level, they are transported to the next level.

The player can reset a level if they get stuck with the escape key.

If the player completes the last level, they can reset all levels with the reset key (escape).

## Outside Tools
The Unity3D engine and Scavengers tutorial were used as a base for building this game. Much of the original code has been removed or reworked into something completely new though. All art assets are original and made using Pixen.
